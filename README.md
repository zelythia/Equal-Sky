## Gameplay

--------

You start only with a single tree and one dirt block. Through sieving things like dirt and gravel, you can obtain almost any other resource you might need. Once you have an item, you can use other items to duplicate it infinitely by using the Crafting- and Sampling Pedestals.\\ Use Aequitas' Collection Bowl to obtain an unlimited amount of unique resources per biome.\\ In the End, craft the Creative Items to never have to worry about Energy, Mana or combat ever again.
